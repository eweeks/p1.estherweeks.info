		<h3>About Me</h3>
		<p>I'm a distance education student hoping to earn a Master's degree in Information
		Technology, with a concentration in digital media arts and instructional design. I did my
		undergrad in art and am hoping to further develop my skills in digital media. I'm really
		looking forward to this course and building on the skills I already have.</p>
		<p>I've been working as a seasonal ranger & naturalist with the National Park Service and 
		split my time between Wyoming and Colorado. I love being outdoors and spend a lot of time
		hiking, backpacking, fishing, and skiing. I also enjoy dance and traveling.</p>
